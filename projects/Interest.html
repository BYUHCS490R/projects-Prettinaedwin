      I’ve always loved reading. For me, books are like little doors into another world. Sometimes
      they let me step into magical adventures, and other times they help me see life from someone
      else’s perspective. Whenever I feel stressed or overwhelmed, picking up a book gives me
      comfort and calm.

      What I enjoy most about books is the way they stay with you. A good story doesn’t end when you
      close the last page—it lingers in your thoughts and becomes a part of you. Reading has taught
      me to dream bigger, to think deeper, and to believe that imagination is powerful.

      A <strong>relative link</strong> is a link that connects to another page on the same website.
      For example, here’s a link to my
      <a href="profilepage.html">Profile Page</a>.  
      An <strong>absolute link</strong> is a complete web address that takes you to another site on
      the internet. Since my interest is books, here’s one of my favorite websites for readers:
      <a href="https://www.goodreads.com" target="_blank">Goodreads</a>.

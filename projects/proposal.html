    <h2>1. Title and Topic of My Site</h2>
    <p><strong>Title:</strong> The Journey to Emotional Strength</p>
    <p><strong>Topic:</strong> My website will focus on emotional well-being, confidence building, and self-improvement for young adults.</p>

    <h3>Why I Chose This Topic</h3>
    <p>
        I chose this topic because emotional strength, confidence, and self-love are things I personally care about and continue to work on.
        I want to create a site that inspires others who struggle with fear, doubt, or insecurity to believe in themselves. This topic is 
        meaningful to me, and building a website about it will help me grow while sharing something uplifting and honor code appropriate.

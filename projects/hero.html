    <h2>Why J.K. Rowling Inspires Me</h2>
    <p id="special-paragraph">
      One of the authors who inspires me the most is <span class="highlight">J.K. Rowling</span>. 
      Her story amazed meâ€”she faced countless struggles before her books were published, yet she never gave up on her dream. 
      I admire how she created the <span class="highlight">Harry Potter world</span>, full of lessons about courage, friendship, and hope.
      Her journey shows that <span class="emphasize">creativity and persistence</span> can change everything.

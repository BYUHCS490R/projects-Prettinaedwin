      One of the authors who inspires me the most is J.K. Rowling. Her story has always amazed me
      she faced so many struggles before her books were finally published, yet she never gave up on
      her dream. I admire the way she created the Harry Potter world, because it feels alive and
      full of lessons about courage, friendship, and hope. Her journey shows me that creativity and
      persistence can change everything.

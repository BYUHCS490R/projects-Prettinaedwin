    <h1>Box model</h1>
    <h2>What is the difference between block tags and inline tags?</h2>
    <p>Box line tages start a new like and end uo with full length and Inline tags stay in line with text and only take as much space as needed</p>
    <h2>What is the margin, border, and padding?</h2>
    <p>Margin is the space outside an element, border is the line surrounding it, and padding is the space between the content and the border.</p>
    <h2>What are units of measurement you can use in CSS?</h2>
    <p>CSS uses absolute units like px, cm, and relative units like %, em, rem, vh, and vw to define sizes and spacing.</p>
    <h2>When would you use a figure tag?</h2>
    <p>The <figure> tag is used to group images, illustrations, or code examples with a caption using <figcaption> to describe the content.</p>

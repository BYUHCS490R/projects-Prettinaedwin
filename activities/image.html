    <h2>Questions and Answers</h2>
    <p><strong>1. What kind of photos are good to encode using JPEG?</strong>
       JPEG is best for photographs and realistic images with many colors and gradients.</p>

    <p><strong>2. What kind of photos are good to encode using GIF?</strong>
       GIF is good for images with few colors, like logos, icons, and simple animations.</p>

    <p><strong>3. What is unique about the PNG format?</strong>
       PNG supports lossless compression and transparency, making it ideal for graphics where quality and transparent backgrounds are needed.</p>

    <p><strong>4. How do you resize your photo to the size it should be displayed?</strong><br>
       You resize the photo using photo editing software to match the dimensions you want it displayed at.</p>

    <p><strong>5. Why should you resize photos using photo editing software instead of resizing it using CSS?</strong><br>
       Resizing photos in software reduces file size and improves page load speed, whereas resizing with CSS only changes the display size without reducing the file size.</p>
